# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
Code implementation of the MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer, as taught in "Make your own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid

This is my own implementation of the MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer, which gets a **97% accuracy** rate, when trained and tested on the original MNIST data. 

The entire Python code is in the form on an IPYNB file which can be accessed seamlessly through Jupyter Notebooks. The datasets used have also been uploaded.
